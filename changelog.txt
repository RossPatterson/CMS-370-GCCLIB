GCCLIB Change LOG
=================

0.7.7 - 3 May 2020
F0013 - Build update - create VMARC source and binary archives

0.7.6 - 2 May 2020
F0012 - Build Update - Create Source tape.
        Updates move FIXRECFM from BUILD EXEC as we want file format
        to be correct for source tape.
        Changes to PREPARE EXEC to remove unwanted macro libraries.
F0011 - Signal and raise to RESLIB
        Make abort() raise SIGABRT signal
        Default SIGABRT signal handler now aborts program
F0010 - Assembler versions of memset, memcpy, memmove
F0009 - Dynamic Stack - longjmp friendly, i.e. needs
        to clear up orphaned allocated stack bins when LESSSTAK
        is called. This keeps longjmp fast, stops memory leaks
        and preserves "non-standard" behaviour people depend on.
        Longjmp and setjmp to RESLIB.
        Stdio.c now uses malloc/free.
        Memory leak detection.
        Memory de-allocation on exit().
F0008 - Dynamic Stack
        Added contrib.txt for all contributed code
        Abort() now uses the auxstack to ensure it can always run
        Abort() no longer calls exit() - i.e. no clean-up as per standards
F0007 - Implement malloc() etc. with DLMALLOC
        which needed RESLIB fix for exit()
        which needed RESLIB fix for assert()
        which needed RESLIB fix for abort()
F0006 - Refactor errno - global variable to anchor struct
        Implement perror()
        Update STDIO library to use perror()
F0005 - Refactor STDIO Logic (global stdin, out and err)

F0004 - Refactor CMSEntry - moving complex logic to C
        Fix Parameter passing (Added Magic EPLIST Marker)
